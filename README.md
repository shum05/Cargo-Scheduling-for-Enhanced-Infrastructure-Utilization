## Optimization of Traffic Flow and Cargo Scheduling for Enhanced Infrastructure Utilization
### Project Overview
The Optimization of Traffic Flow and Cargo Scheduling for Enhanced Infrastructure Utilization project aims to improve the efficiency of transportation infrastructure by analyzing traffic flow patterns and optimizing cargo delivery schedules at high-volume locations. By integrating real-time data on traffic flow, cargo schedules, weather conditions, road incidents, and road networks, this project utilizes data analytics and machine learning techniques to minimize congestion, reduce delays, and optimize resource allocation.

The project is structured around the following key objectives:

**Optimizing Traffic Flow:** Analyzing historical traffic data to predict congestion and recommend infrastructure usage improvements.
**Cargo Scheduling:** Developing an optimized cargo schedule that minimizes delays, maximizes resource usage, and accounts for factors such as traffic conditions and road incidents.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
To run this project, you must have Python 3.7+ installed. The required libraries are listed in requirements.txt and can be installed using the following command:
```
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage
**Data Cleaning:**

Run scripts/data_cleaning.py to preprocess and clean the raw data files stored in the data/ folder.
This script ensures that the data is formatted properly, missing values are handled, and outliers are dealt with.
**Traffic Analysis:**

Open the Jupyter notebook notebooks/traffic_analysis.ipynb to explore and analyze traffic flow data.
Use scripts/traffic_model.py to develop and train predictive models that can forecast traffic patterns, such as congestion hotspots and peak traffic hours.
**Cargo Scheduling Optimization:**

Open the Jupyter notebook notebooks/cargo_schedule_optimization.ipynb to examine cargo movement patterns and create optimized schedules.
Use scripts/cargo_optimization.py to apply optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, linear programming) to minimize delays and avoid peak congestion periods.
### Example Workflow
**Data Preprocessing:**

Use scripts/data_cleaning.py to preprocess all raw data files in the data/ folder.
This includes handling missing data, outliers, and converting variables to the proper format.
**Traffic Flow Prediction:**

Analyze traffic data by running scripts/traffic_model.py to predict high-traffic hours and identify congestion factors.
Visualize traffic flow patterns in the notebooks/traffic_analysis.ipynb file.
**Cargo Optimization:**

Analyze and optimize cargo schedules using scripts/cargo_optimization.py to reduce delays and maximize resource utilization.
Consider factors such as weather conditions, road incidents, and peak traffic periods to improve scheduling efficiency.
### Results
The project generates data-driven insights that can be used to minimize traffic congestion and optimize cargo scheduling.
Visualizations of traffic flow and cargo schedules are saved in the reports/visualizations/ folder.
Key findings and recommendations are documented in reports/findings_summary.md.
