# Cargo-Scheduling-for-Enhanced-Infrastructure-Utilization
# Optimization of Traffic Flow and Cargo Scheduling for Enhanced Infrastructure Utilization

## Project Overview

The **Optimization of Traffic Flow and Cargo Scheduling for Enhanced Infrastructure Utilization** project aims to streamline traffic and cargo management at high-volume locations. Using real-time data such as traffic flow counts, cargo schedules, weather conditions, incidents, and road networks, the project utilizes data analytics and machine learning to minimize congestion, optimize cargo delivery schedules, and enhance infrastructure utilization.

This project is structured to address two primary objectives:
1. **Optimizing Traffic Flow** - Analyzing traffic patterns and predicting congestion to provide insights for efficient infrastructure use.
2. **Cargo Scheduling** - Developing a cargo schedule that minimizes delays and maximizes resource allocation.

### Data Files
Traffic_Flow.csv: Logs hourly traffic data at different checkpoints, including vehicle counts and average speed.
**Cargo_Schedule.csv:** Contains information about scheduled cargo movements, with details about origins, destinations, type, and weight of cargo.
**Weather_Data.csv:** Provides weather data, including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and visibility, to assess its impact on traffic.
**Incident_Report.csv:** Logs incidents such as accidents and construction that could impact traffic flow.
**Road_Network.csv:** Details the road network between locations to aid in route and scheduling optimization.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Python installed. Required libraries are listed in requirements.txt and can be installed with:
```
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Usage
Data Cleaning: Execute data_cleaning.py to preprocess and clean all data files in the data folder.

### Traffic Analysis:

Open notebooks/traffic_analysis.ipynb to analyze traffic patterns.
Run traffic_model.py to build and evaluate predictive models for traffic flow.

### Cargo Scheduling Optimization:

Open notebooks/cargo_schedule_optimization.ipynb for exploratory analysis of cargo scheduling.
Run cargo_optimization.py to develop and apply optimization algorithms.

### Example Workflow
**Data Preprocessing:** The initial step involves cleaning and formatting the data using data_cleaning.py.
**Traffic Flow Prediction:** The traffic model analyzes flow patterns, predicts peak times, and identifies potential congestion.
**Cargo Optimization:** Cargo schedules are optimized to avoid peak times and minimize transport delays by considering weather, road conditions, and incidents.
### Results
The project output includes data-driven recommendations to reduce congestion and optimize cargo movements. Visualizations and summaries are saved in the reports/visualizations folder, and key findings are documented in findings_summary.md.

### Project Roadmap
**Data Analysis:** Explore and visualize data to understand patterns and correlations.
Traffic Prediction Modeling: Use machine learning models to predict high-traffic hours and analyze influential factors.
**Cargo Scheduling:** Apply optimization techniques to improve scheduling efficiency.
**Evaluation and Insights:** Validate results, compare them to baseline conditions, and provide actionable insights.
